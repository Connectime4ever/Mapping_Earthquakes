# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

### To add a third map to the former map that had been created by adding earthquake data as an overlay to two different tile layers so the user could turn the earthquake data on and off. 

### With this project the user will be able to see those earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 4.5 in relation with the tectonic plates' location on the earth.
