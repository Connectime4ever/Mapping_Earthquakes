# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

#### The purpose of this project is adding new functionalities to the  former earthquakes map, created with recorded earthquakes in the past 7 days. In that former map the earthquake data had been overlaid to two different tile layers. The user was able to turn the earthquake data on and off. 

#### The project allows the user to see also earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 4.5 in relation with the tectonic plates' location on the earth. 

#### The tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object with the earthquake data. Additionaly, a third map style is also added as a tile layer object.
