# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

#### It was requested to add new functionalities to a former earthquakes map.  That original map had been created by adding earthquake data of the recorded earthquakes in the past 7 days. The earthquake data was overlaid to two different tile layers for the user to be able to turn the earthquake data on and off. 

#### With this new project the user will be able to see those earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 4.5 in relation with the tectonic plates' location on the earth. 

#### The tectonic plate data will be added to the overlay object with the earthquake data. 

#### Additionaly, a third map style as a tile layer object.
